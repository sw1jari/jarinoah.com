## **Instructions**

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together **1 cup (240g) full-fat yogurt**, **1 Tbsp (15g) garam masala**, and **1 Tbsp (15g) kosher salt**.
2. Toss **1 1/2 lbs (680g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs** with the mixture until fully coated. Cover and marinate for 30 minutes or overnight.
3. In a large pan, heat **2 Tbsp (30g) vegetable oil** over medium-high heat until shimmering hot.
4. Add chicken in batches and sear for 2-3 minutes on each side. Set aside once done.
5. Lower the same pan to medium heat, and if needed, add a touch more oil. Add **1 diced yellow onion**, **2-inch knob of ginger (finely diced)**, and **6 cloves of sliced garlic**. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Saut√© for 2-3 minutes or until softened.
6. Stir in **2 tsp (8g) paprika**, **2 tsp (9g) ground cumin**, **1 Tbsp (14g) garam masala**, and **1 1/2 tsp (6g) turmeric powder** (if using). Toast the spices for 1-2 minutes.
7. After toasting, mix in **14oz crushed tomatoes** and **2/3 cup (160ml) water**. Stir over medium heat and let simmer for 5-8 minutes, or until the sauce has reduced.
8. Once reduced, return the seared chicken to the pan, ensuring it's covered with the sauce. Let it simmer for 3-5 minutes.
9. Stir in **1 cup (240ml) heavy cream** until the mixture thickens. Bring it to a light simmer before reducing the heat to low, and let it simmer for no longer than 3-4 minutes. Stir often.
10. Turn off the heat and continuously stir in **2 Tbsp (28g) unsalted butter** until melted. Season to taste with salt.
11. Serve in a shallow bowl over steamed rice and top with fresh cilantro.
