## **Instructions**

1. In a large bowl, whisk together **1 cup (240g) full-fat yogurt**, **1 Tbsp (15g) garam masala**, and **1 Tbsp (15g) kosher salt**.
   
2. Toss the **cauliflower florets** and **drained chickpeas** in the yogurt mixture until fully coated. Let them marinate for 30 minutes.

3. In a large pan, heat **2 Tbsp (30g) vegetable oil** over medium-high heat until shimmering hot.
   
4. Add the marinated cauliflower and chickpeas, sautéing until the cauliflower florets are golden brown and the chickpeas are slightly crispy. Set aside once done.

5. In the same pan, lower the heat to medium, and if needed, add a touch more oil. Add **1 diced yellow onion**, **2-inch knob of ginger (finely diced)**, and **6 cloves of sliced garlic**. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Sauté for 2-3 minutes or until softened.

6. Stir in **2 tsp (8g) paprika**, **2 tsp (9g) ground cumin**, **1 Tbsp (14g) garam masala**, and **1 1/2 tsp (6g) turmeric powder** (if using). Toast the spices for 1-2 minutes.

7. After toasting, mix in **14oz crushed tomatoes** and **2/3 cup (160ml) water**. Stir over medium heat and let simmer for 5-8 minutes, or until the sauce has reduced.

8. Return the sautéed cauliflower and chickpeas to the pan, ensuring they're covered with the sauce. Let simmer for 3-5 minutes.

9. Stir in **1 cup (240ml) heavy cream** until the mixture thickens. Bring to a light simmer before reducing the heat to low, and simmer for 3-4 minutes, stirring often.

10. Turn off the heat and continuously stir in **2 Tbsp (28g) unsalted butter** until melted. Season to taste with salt.

11. Serve in a shallow bowl over steamed rice and top with fresh cilantro.
